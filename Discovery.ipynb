    "## Federal Legislative Actions\n",
    "- One way to look at how the Federal Government has tried to affect environmental issues is to look at the number of proposed and enacted legislation over the past few congresses. The Library of Congress (www.congress.gov) has a searchable database showing all legislative actions taken by congress. Often this is difficult because the term \"environment\" will show up when legislation isn't really directed toward the environment. For example, an appropriations bill that funds the EPA. This is an exercise in finding legislation that is directly tied to environmental issues and appropriately tagging those items to quantify the attempts (successful or not) at enacting environmental laws."

secretary  publishes  therein  detailed  reasonswhy such regulation is necessary; and(b)  in  the  case  such  regulation  applies  to  resident  speciesof  fish  or  wildlife,  or  plants,  the  secretary  gives  actual  noticeof  such  regulation  to  the  state  agency  in  each  state  in  whichsuch species is believed to occur.such regulation shall, at the discretion of the secretary, take effectimmediately  upon  the  publication  of  the  regulation  in  the  federalregister.  any  regulation  promulgated  under  the  authority  of  thisparagraph  shall  cease  to  have  force  and  effect  at  the  close  of  the240-day period following the date of publication unless, during such240-day  period,  the  rulemaking  procedures  which  would  apply  tosuch  regulation  without  regard  to  this  paragraph  are  compliedwith. if at any time after issuing an emergency regulation the sec-retary  determines,  on  the  basis  of  the  best  appropriate  data  avail-able  to  him,  that  substantial  evidence  does  not  exist  to  warrantsuch regulation, he shall withdraw it.(8)  the  publication  in  the  federal  register  of  any  proposed  orfinal  regulation  which  is

of  commerce  to  be  endangered  species  and  a  list  of  all  spe-cies determined by him or the secretary of commerce to be threat-ened  species.  each  list  shall  refer  to  the  species  contained  thereinby  scientific  and  common  name  or  names,  if  any,  specify  with  re-spect to such species over what portion of its range it is endangeredor  threatened,  and  specify  any  critical  habitat  within  such  range.the  secretary  shall  from  time  to  time  revise  each  list  publishedunder  the  authority  of  this  subsection  to  reflect  recent  determina-tions,  designations,  and  revisions  made  in  accordance  with  sub-sections (a) and (b).(2) the secretary shall—(a)  conduct,  at  least  once  every  five  years,  a  review  of  allspecies  included  in  a  list  which  is  published  pursuant  to  para-graph (1) and which is in effect at the time of such review; and(b)  determine  on  the  basis  of  such  review  whether  anysuch species should—(i) be removed from such list;(ii)  be  changed  in  status  from  an  endangered  speciesto a threatened species; oran endangered species.(iii)  be  changed  in  status  from  a  threatened  species

threatened  species  pursuant  to  subsection  (c)  of  this  section,the  secretary  shall  issue  such  regulations  as  he  deems  necessaryand  advisable  to  provide  for  the  conservation  of  such  species.  thesecretary  may  by  regulation  prohibit  with  respect  to  any  threat-ened  species  any  act  prohibited  under  section  9(a)(1),  in  the  caseof  fish  or  wildlife,  or  section  9(a)(2)  in  the  case  of  plants,  with  re-spect  to  endangered  species;  except  that  with  respect  to  the  takingof  resident  species  of  fish  or  wildlife,  such,  regulations  shall  applyin  any  state  which  has  entered  into  a  cooperative  agreement  pur-suant to section 6(c) of this act only to the extent that such regula-tions have also been adopted by such state.(e)  similarity  of  appearance  cases.—the  secretary  may,  byregulation  of  commerce  or  taking,  and  to  the  extent  he  deems  ad-visable,  treat  any  species  as  an  endangered  species  or  threatenedspecies  even  through  it  is  not  listed  pursuant  to  section  4  of  thisact if he finds that—(a) such species so closely resembles in appearance, at thepoint  in  question,  a  species  which  has  been  listed  pursuant  tosuch  section  that  enforcement  personnel  would  have  substan-tial  difficulty  in  attempting  to  differentiate  between  the  listedand unlisted species;(b)  the  effect  of  this  substantial  difficulty  is  an  additionalthreat to an endangered or threatened species; and(c) such treatment of an unlisted species will substantiallyfacilitate the enforcement and further the policy of this act.\\x0c23513endangered  species  act  of  1973sec.  4(f)(1)  recovery  plans.—the  secretary  shall  develop  and  im-plement

determination,  in  accordance  with  theprovisions of this section, that the species be removed fromthe list; and(iii)  estimates  of  the  time  required  and  the  cost  tocarry out those measures needed to achieve the plan’s goaland to achieve intermediate steps toward that goal.(2)  the  secretary,  in  developing  and  implementing  recoveryplans,  may  procure  the  services  of

    "- The Federal Government's Strategic Planning process was designed to connect programs and resources to the goals and objectives each administration intends to affect. The overall strategic plans provide a narrative about what the administration's plan is to affect the change and the Annual Performance Report details progress. Although narrative in these reports provide insight into key initiatives and actions taken, they also include specific metrics that provide objective and measurable outcomes to measure performance. Below are the goals, objectives, and metrics measured in the last Annual Perfomance Report for the Trump and Obama administrations. Because each administration sets their own strategic plans, the ability to compare performance across administrations is difficult. Lagged data also makes it difficult to measure performance or outcomes for the administration itself. Finding sources for these data (in machine readable format) that live beyond an administration makes these measurements more useful for the public to understand how each successive administration has either continued to advance, held steady, or rolled back performance compared to the prior administration. This exercise will help the public better understand the affects of administration change on the measures in the EPA strategic plans."
